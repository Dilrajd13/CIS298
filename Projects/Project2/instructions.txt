Create a retirement planning calculator
Ask the user how old they are, and how old they want to be when they retire.
Ask the user for 4 starting balances
Money stored under their mattress
Money in bank savings - earns a fixed 2% done

Money in bonds - read from the bond rate file

Money in stocks - read from the stock file

For every year until they retire, ask if they want to put money into any of the 4 accounts,
allow them to keep adding money until they are done

Apply yearly rate of return to the accounts

print current balances of each account and total balance

also print the yearly account balances and total to a csv file ( wait for end is most efficient )

After they reach retirement age, print totals for each account, total retirement savings,
 and then an adjusted balance for inflation - assume a 2% inflation
